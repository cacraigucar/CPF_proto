# User's Guide

The cam_kessler code calls CCPP-compliant
physics schemes through the CCPP infrastructure code. As such, it requires the
CCPP infrastructure code and physics code, both of which are included as git
submodules within the SCM code. 

## Obtaining Code
    
  git clone -b cac_kessler https://cacraigucar@github.com/cacraigucar/cam_kessler.git
     -- or --
  git clone -b cac_kessler_nottested https://cacraigucar@github.com/cacraigucar/cam_kessler.git

  cd cam_kessler
  manage_externals/checkout_externals

  ccpp-framework/scripts/ccpp_prebuild.py --model=cam_kessler
  Note: add `--debug` to see the full output of the script.
